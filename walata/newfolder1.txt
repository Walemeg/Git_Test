I am a great guy learning linux for devops

Linux Commands

pwd - means present working directory, shows current folder we are in
ls --> lst files in current directory/folder we are in 
Touch --> creates file (not folder)
Cat --> read the content in new file
Clear or CTL L  --> clear all commands used in linux CLI windows
tail newfolder.txt --> show last few lines in the newfolder text file while "cat" command reads everything
Head newfolder.txt --> show first few lines in the newfolder text file
Which pwd --> All command used is a program stored somewhere; which command tells us where the program is stored
info or man --> the commands gives us description of a linux command e.g info which , man  (didnt work in Git bash)
mkdir folder --> to create a new folder called "folder1"
mkdir folder1/folderinside --> creating a folder called "folderinside" inside "folder1"
$ mkdir folder1/folderinside/secondfolderinside --> creating another folder into the "folderinside2" using forward slash

Remember we are currently in a folder or directory called "devops" thaty contains a new folder called "folder1", 
folder1 contains a folder called folderinside1 and folderinside1 contains a folder called "secondfolderinside"

CD command is used for moving from one folder to the other and check what is there.
$ cd folder1/  --> we want to change directory from where we are "devops" folder to "folder1"located inside "devops"
$ cd downloads/devops/folder1/folderinside/secondfolderinside  -----> we can change our directory/location from downloads to teh last folder and 
									also revert back using just "cd" or "cd -" command
ERICSSON+eademeg@E-5CG22609K8 MINGW64 ~/downloads/devops
$ cd folder1/
$ pwd
/c/Users/eademeg/downloads/devops/folder1
$ ls
folderinside/
$ cd folderinside/
ERICSSON+eademeg@E-5CG22609K8 MINGW64 ~/downloads/devops/folder1/folderinside
$ ls
secondfolderinside/
$ cd  --> just typeing cd or "cd -"command will take us back to the beginning of directory/folder "eademeg" as shown below
$ pwd
/c/Users/eademeg  --> note that download folder is inside "eademeg" folder

/c/Users/eademeg/downloads/devops/folder1/folderinside
$ cd downloads/devops/folder1/folderinside  ----->
